#  Reel Talk üé•üçøiOS Developer Intern Challenge

** Version 1.0.0 **
- Created a Frontend Challenge Following IOS Desing best practices
- Orientation Lock: I implemented orientation lock in my app. This means that when users interact with the app, I control the allowed screen orientations. For example, I ensure that the app remains in portrait mode even if the user rotates their device to landscape mode. This provides a consistent user experience and prevents unexpected screen rotations.
- Navigation Stack: In my app, I set up a navigation stack to guide users through different sections of the application. When users navigate to different screens or views, I manage this hierarchical flow using a navigation controller. This allows users to go back to previous screens easily, making the app more user-friendly and intuitive.
- I've organized my code to create reusable objects and components within the app. This includes using custom views, SwiftUI components, and modular code structures. By doing this, I ensure that similar functionality or UI elements are encapsulated in reusable components. For example, I've created custom SwiftUI views like "GenreChip" or "ButtonModifications" that can be easily reused throughout the app. This approach not only enhances code maintainability but also promotes consistency in the app's design and functionality.

- Stack: Swift, SwiftUI, Git, MVVM
